        "detail": "Many drivers find it tempting to simply pay the fine for a traffic ticket rather than go through the trouble of contesting it. However, for speeding violations, the true cost extends far beyond the ticket itself. Beyond the direct monetary impact such as penalty points affecting your driving record, there is a long-term financial burden including increased vehicle insurance rates for at least three years. If you choose to plead guilty and pay the ticket without considering the broader impact, the real cost becomes even more complicated."

We have 25 years of experience in this field. Don't just pay the fine or attempt to contest it alone in court.

Charges for using handheld wireless devices include any interaction, holding, or use of the device while driving, excluding emergency calls, even when stopped at red lights or stop signs. Similarly, charges for handheld electronic entertainment devices include MP3 or DVD players, televisions, and computers."

Novice drivers face escalating penalties. Any conviction for seatbelt violations will remain on your driving record for three years. Failing to wear a seatbelt while driving or as a passenger will not result in demerit points. However, any other seatbelt violations will result in two demerit points on your driving license."

        "detail": "When can your license be suspended? Your permit may be suspended for many reasons, including: failure to pay traffic tickets or fines, alcohol-related criminal conduct, medical reasons, and demerit points. Now, the cost of driving during a suspension may be even higher than the license itself. Since December 1, 2010, police have more tools to remove suspended and injured drivers from the road. A 7-day vehicle seizure applies to drivers with suspended licenses. Being convicted of driving during suspension can affect your insurance for at least three years."

In Ontario, you can lose your driving privileges in multiple ways. Don't just pay the fine or attempt to contest it alone in court. We can help you. Our commitment is to relentlessly pursue complete elimination of your charges. If complete elimination is not possible, we will work to reduce the charges and mitigate their impact."
